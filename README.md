# Features

## Sync your Neovim config

You sign up with GitHub to sync your Neovim config

The sync parses the contents of the files in the GitHub repository of your Neovim config to identify meta data about your config.

- What plugins you have installed in your config
- What plugin manager you use

## Plugin Search

- Search for plugins based on name and tags
- Sort the results based on popularity or how new the plugin is.
- Go to the plugins page
    - View plugin details
    - View similar plugins
    - Read the plugins Readme 
    - See configs that have installed the plugin

## Config Search

- Search for Neovim configs based on author, name, init file and plugin manager
- Sort the results based on popularity or how new the plugin is.
- Go to the config page
    - View config details
    - See plugins installed in the config

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and much appreciated! 

As dotfyle has been submitted to [SvelteHack](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) the production app will not be updated until May 6th when winners have been decided. This is so that Dotfyle can be fairly evaluated based on the timeframe of the hackathon.

Please base any contributions on the temporary `dev` branch until then.
